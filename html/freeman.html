            Biography
        </h2>
        <p class="red">
            <strong><span>With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor,</span></strong> this ever popular American actor
            has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis,
            Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended
            Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959.
            His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of
            the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="green">
            Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the
            Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show <span>The Electric Company</span> (1971). He then moved into feature
            film with another children's adventure, <span>Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow!</span> (1971). Next, there was a small role
            in the thriller <span>Blade</span> (1973); then he played Casca in <span>Julius Caesar</span> (1979) and the title role in <span>Coriolanus</span> (1979).
        </p>
        <p class="blue"> 
            Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas <span>Attica</span> (1980) and <span>Brubaker</span>
            (1980), <span>Eyewitness</span> (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981).
            For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in
            their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a>            nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second
            <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination in the film version of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driving_miss_daisy"
                target="movies">Driving Miss Daisy</a> (1989) opposite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/"> Jessica Tandy</a>.
            The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil
            War drama <a href="pages/glory.html">Glory</a> (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African
            American fighting brigade.
